# Crenshaw's Compiler

This code follows Jack Crenshaw's "Let's build a compiler" series of articles.

You will need a Pascal compiler to build this code.

I recommend "FreePascal".

On Fedora, you can install this with:

`dnf install fpc`

(I will make a version in a more sensible programming language one day)
